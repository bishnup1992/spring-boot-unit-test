Hi Sravan,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the issue we discussed during yesterday's call concerning the merchant feed not reaching the Downstream Team (LPE).

Upon further investigation, we have identified that the issue was related to our DR Switch Activity. I'm pleased to inform you that we have successfully resolved this issue, and the merchant feed is now functioning as expected.

As discussed, this feed is part of our daily refresh process, and we have confirmed with the business that there is no requirement for the LPC Feed that you mentioned during the previous window. Therefore, there will be no impact on missing feeds from the past day.

The corrective measures we have taken ensure that the merchant feed will now reach LPE as part of their Business As Usual (BAU) operations.

If you have any remaining concerns or questions regarding this matter, please feel free to reach out. We are committed to ensuring the smooth operation of our systems and addressing any issues promptly.
