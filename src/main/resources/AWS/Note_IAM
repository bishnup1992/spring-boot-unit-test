Aws Services
----------------
Compute and Network Services
Storage and Content Delivery Services
Security and identity Services
Database Services
Analytics Services
Application Services
Managemnet and Tool

Cloud Services Model (Types of Cloud Computing)
-----------------------
IAAS - Infa as a Service (AWS,RackSpace,Azure)
PAAS - Platform as a Service (AWS Beanstack,Heroku)
SAAS - Software as a Service (Google Drives,Google Docs MS Office, Rekognition for ML)

Cloud Deployement Model
------------------------
Public Cloud (AWS, AZURE,GCP,IBM Bluemix)
Private Cloud (HPE,VMware,RedHat Open Stack, Dell EMC)
Hybrid Cloud

EC2 -> Virtual Computing Env (Its a combination of CPU,Mem, Network Latency)
	Instance types
		-General Purpose
		-Memory Optimized
		-Storage Optimized
		-Accelerated Computing
		-Compute Optimized
AMI -> Amazon Machine Images

Elastaic Network Interface
	This Contains
	-Elastaic IP
	-Public IP
	-Private IP
	-Security Group

How to refresh the instance
	sudo apt-get update

Cloud Computing -> On Demand Delivery of
						-Compute Power
						-data base Storage
						-other IT Resourse
Pay-as-you-go-pricing
You can have Resourse instancely without waiting
Simply way to access Server,Strorage, DB with Web Application

5 Characterstic of Cloud Computing
	-On Demand Self Service
	-Broad Network Access
	-Multi-tenancy and Resourse Polling
	-Rapid Elasticity and Scalabilty
	-Measured Service
6 Adavantage of Cloud Computing
 -Trade capital Expense (CAPEX) for Opertaional Expense (OPEX)
	pay on-Demand , donot own hardware
	Reduce the Total Cost of OwnerShip (TCO) & OPEX
 -Benifits of Massive Economies of Scale
 -Stop Guessing Capacity
 -Increase Speed and Agility
 -Stoping Spending money on running and maintainig activity
 -Go Global in Minitues

Problem Solved by Cloud
- Flexibility : Change Resourse Type when needed
-Cost Effective
-Scalabilty
-Elasticity
-High Availaibity and Fault Tolerance
-Agility

AWS Service have both Global Services & Region Specific
	Global Service
	-IAM
	-Route 53
	-CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
	-WAF (Web application Firewall)

	Region Services
	-Amazon EC2  (IAAS)
	-Elastaic Beanstack (PAAS)
	-Lamda (Function as a Service)
	-Rekognition (SAAS)

Shared Responsibility
---------------------
Customer -> Response for the Security In the Cloud
AWS -> Security Of the Cloud

Pricing Fundamental of Aws
-Compute
-Storage
-Data transfer out of AWS Cloud

AWS Regions are composed of : 3 or More Availaibity Zones

Q) What is Cloud Computing?
Ans)On- Demand availibility Computer System Resourse,Data Storage,and Computing Power
without direct Active Managemnet by User.

IAM Service
--------------
-Its a Global Service
-All the user must have a Group
-Same user Can be part of Multiple Group
-User or Group can be assigned to a Json Doc called policies
-These policies define the permission for the user
-Provide Least Privilage Access to User

Aws Root user
	 Login Though EMAIL ID
	 bishnumishraaws@gmail.com
	 Password : Normal
IAM User
Account ID:	bishnu-aws-admin
IAM User Name: bishnu-admin
Pwd: Normal

IAM Polices
-------------


Policies
------------
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
IAM Polices
Ex:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:*",
                "organizations:DescribeAccount",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit",
                "organizations:DescribePolicy",
                "organizations:ListChildren",
                "organizations:ListParents",
                "organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget",
                "organizations:ListRoots",
                "organizations:ListPolicies",
                "organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


IAM Password Polices
------------------------
You can setup the password policy
Allow all the IAM user to update reset their Password
Require user to change the password after expiry
Prevent password reuse

MFA (Multi Factor Auth)
-------------------------
You have to protect your Root Accounts and IAM User
MFA = Password + Security Device you own

MFA Option in Aws
----------------------
Google Authenticator
Authy (Support for Multi Token on a single device)
Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key (Physical Device)
Hardware Key

How Can user Access Aws
	- Aws Managemnet Console (Password +MFA)
	- AWS Command line Interface (Protected By Access Key)
	- Aws Software Development Kit (For Code : protected By Access Key)

Access key can be generated through AWS Managemnet Console, Donot Share the Access Key its User Specific




Access Key  : AKIAQFDC3WSJL7U3MXLT
Secret access key : 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

IAM Role For Services
------------------------
Common Role
	Ec2 Instance Role
	Lamda Function Role
	Roles for Cloud Formation

Create a Role , May be used for Ec2 Service
Then Attach Polices to that Role ex: IAMReadonly
Then Create Role

IAM Security Tools
------------------
 - IAM Credentials Report (Accout -level)
	- Report on List of all your accounts users and Status of their Credentials
 - IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
	-its Shows permission granted to a user
	- we can use this info to revise the policies of user
	-Basiclly help which service used by the user , if service not used by user we can remove the access


IAM Best Practice
----------------------
Donot use AWS Root User Account
One Physical User = One Aws user
Assign user to group and assign permission to group
Create a strong password policies
Use and Enforce the User to use MFA
Create and Use Roles to give permission to Access AWS Service
Use Access Key for Programatic access
Regularly Audit the permission of you Account and User through Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
Never Share your IAM User and Access Key

Shared Responsibility For IAM
-------------------------------------
Aws
- Handel Infrasture (Global Network Security)
-Configuration and vulnerbility Analysis
-Compliance validation

As User
-User group,Role, Polices
-Enable MFA
-Rotate all the Keys
-Give appropriate permission to user
-Analyze access patterns and review permission
