Business Result
====================
Long version
================
In the past year, I have successfully accomplished several significant milestones that have contributed to the growth and efficiency of our organization. I would like to highlight the following key achievements:

DCM Migration: I led the successful DCM Migration project, which involved a last-minute inclusion of merchant data. Despite facing numerous challenges, my team and I overcame these hurdles. The migration from the Old Documentum server to the OMNI AEM Server has significantly improved business accessibility while reducing the overhead of the legacy Documentum server.

Decommissioning Old Documentum Server: I actively participated in the decommissioning of the old Documentum server, ensuring a smooth transition to the new AEM Server. This process was critical to maintaining our business operations without disruptions.

Performance Validation: After the successful DCM Migration, I played a role in validating the performance of the new AEM Server. Ensuring the server's efficiency was a crucial step in our migration process.

Stepping into a New AEM Project: Towards the year-end, I transitioned into a new project built on innovative technology. Despite the challenges, I quickly adapted and started addressing issues and vulnerabilities in the code. This initiative significantly improved our system's throughput and coding standards.

By achieving these goals and stepping into new projects, I have demonstrated my dedication to the organization's success, adaptability, and my commitment to maintaining high standards of work. Looking forward to the coming year, I remain focused on delivering results and contributing positively to our organization's growth.

Over the past year, I have maintained a strong commitment to our clients, customers, and stakeholders. I would like to highlight the following key achievements that reflect my focus on their needs and satisfaction:

DCM Migration Stakeholder Engagement: During the DCM Migration project, I encountered several challenges, including the last-minute need to create Data Sharing Templates (DSTs) for other teams. This required extensive discussions and coordination with multiple stakeholders. Furthermore, I worked with the Downstream team to establish new SFTP routes for Production Environment migration. Despite tight deadlines, I extended my working hours to ensure the successful DCM Migration, underscoring my dedication to fulfilling the needs of our stakeholders.

Involvement in AEM Project: Towards the year-end, I transitioned into a new and challenging AEM project, which was a completely different domain for me. I encountered difficulties in understanding the AEM workflow. To overcome these challenges, I proactively connected with the AEM team to understand business flows, addressing both business and technical issues. Additionally, I tackled numerous UI challenges in this process. This required extended hours and collaboration with multiple stakeholders, including the Product Owner.

These accomplishments reflect my dedication to client, customer, and stakeholder satisfaction. I remain committed to addressing their needs, providing effective solutions, and delivering value in all endeavors. In the upcoming year, I will continue to prioritize their requirements and contribute to our organization's growth and success.
