Problem Statement:
The existing Scribe system encounters performance issues due to suboptimal Elasticsearch queries, leading to delayed responses and decreased efficiency in data retrieval.

Solution:
To address this challenge, a solution is being developed to optimize the Scribe Elasticsearch queries. This involves revising and refining the queries to enhance their efficiency and improve overall system performance.

Outcome:
Upon successful implementation of the optimized queries, we anticipate a significant improvement in the Scribe system's responsiveness. Faster data retrieval and reduced latency will contribute to an enhanced user experience and increased overall efficiency in handling data through the Scribe platform.

Problem Statement:
Daily jobs in Scribe encounter disruptions due to occasional data processing failures, requiring a solution for seamless recovery.

Solution:
Implementing retry logic to automatically recover the job in case of failure during data processing.

Outcome:
Enhanced resilience and reliability of the Scribe daily job process, ensuring consistent performance and improved data processing reliability.
